      "xxbos xxmaj this is a extremely well - made film . xxmaj the acting , script and camera - work are all first - rate . xxmaj the music is good , too , though it is mostly early in the film , when things are still relatively xxunk . xxmaj there are no really xxunk in the cast , though several faces will be familiar . xxmaj the entire cast does an excellent job with the script . \n",
      "\n",
      " xxmaj but it is hard to watch , because there is no good end to a situation like the one presented . xxmaj it is now xxunk to blame the xxmaj british for setting xxmaj hindus and xxmaj muslims against each other , and then xxunk xxunk them into two countries . xxmaj there is some merit in this view , but it 's also true that no one forced xxmaj hindus and xxmaj muslims in the region to xxunk each other as they did around the time of partition . xxmaj it seems more likely that the xxmaj british simply saw the xxunk between the xxunk and were clever enough to exploit them to their own ends . \n",
